# R Plotting Script

## Overview
This R script creates a grid of plots using base plotting system. The plots include histograms, bar charts, box plots, scatter plots, and regression line plots, utilizing the `mtcars` dataset in R.

## Requirements
- R environment
- `datasets` library

## Instructions
1. Ensure you have R installed on your system.
2. Make sure you have the `datasets` library installed. If not, you can install it using `install.packages("datasets")`.
3. Download the provided R script (`plotting_script.R`) to your local machine.
4. Open the R script in your preferred text editor or R environment.
5. Run the script in R to generate the grid of plots.

## Description of Plots
1. **Histogram of MPG**: Shows the distribution of miles per gallon.
2. **Bar Chart of Cylinders**: Displays the frequency of cars with different numbers of cylinders.
3. **Box Plot of Horsepower**: Shows the spread and outliers of horsepower data.
4. **Scatter Plot of MPG vs HP**: Displays the relationship between miles per gallon and horsepower.
5. **Scatter Plot of WT vs MPG**: Shows the relationship between car weight and miles per gallon.
6. **Regression Line of WT vs MPG**: Shows the scatter plot of weight vs miles per gallon with a fitted regression line.
